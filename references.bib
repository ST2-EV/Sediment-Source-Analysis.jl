  abstract = {Machine learning methods extract value from vast data sets quickly and with modest resources. They are established tools in a wide range of industrial applications, including search engines, DNA sequencing, stock market analysis, and robot locomotion, and their use is spreading rapidly. People who know the methods have their choice of rewarding jobs. This hands-on text opens these opportunities to computer science students with modest mathematical backgrounds. It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

  abstract = {Non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) is a widely used multi-way analysis approach that factorizes a high-order non-negative data tensor into several non-negative factor matrices. In NTF, the non-negative rank has to be predetermined to specify the model and it greatly influences the factorized matrices. However, its value is conventionally determined by specialists’ insights or trial and error. This paper proposes a novel rank selection criterion for NTF on the basis of the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Our methodology is unique in that (1) we apply the MDL principle on tensor slices to overcome a problem caused by the imbalance between the number of elements in a data tensor and that in factor matrices, and (2) we employ the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) code-length for histogram densities. We employ synthetic and real data to empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms other criteria in terms of accuracies for estimating true ranks and for completing missing values. We further show that our method can produce ranks suitable for knowledge discovery.},

Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., N -way arrays with N ≥ 3) have applications in psychometrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},

They differ only slightly in  the multiplicative factor used in the update rules. One algorithm can be  shown to minimize the conventional least squares error while the other  minimizes the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence. The monotonic  convergence of both algorithms can be proven using an auxiliary func-  tion analogous to that used for proving convergence of the Expectation-  Maximization algorithm. The algorithms can also be interpreted as diag-  onally rescaled gradient descent, where the rescaling factor is optimally  chosen to ensure convergence.},

  abstract = {The detrital zircons in tills overlying the Guichon Creek batholith, British Columbia, Canada, have trace element concentrations and ages similar to those of zircons from the bedrock samples from which they are interpreted to have been sourced. Rocks from the core of the batholith that host porphyry copper mineralization have distinct zircon compositions relative to the distal, barren margin. We analyzed 296 zircons separated from 12 subglacial till samples to obtain U-Pb ages and trace element compositions. Laser ablation U-Pb ages of the detrital zircons overlap within error with chemical abrasion-thermal ionization mass spectrometry U-Pb ages of the Late Triassic Guichon Creek batholith and confirm that the detrital zircons are likely derived from the batholith. The youngest intrusions of the batholith produced the Highland Valley Copper porphyry deposits and contain distinctive zircons with elevated Eu/EuN* \&gt;0.4 attributed to high magmatic water contents and oxidation states, indicating higher porphyry copper potential. Zircon from till samples adjacent to and 9~km down-ice from the mineralized centers have mean Eu/EuN* \&gt;0.4, which are indicative of potential porphyry copper mineralization. Detrital zircon grains from more distal up- and down-ice locations (10–15~km) have zircon Eu/EuN* mean values of 0.26 to 0.37, reflecting background values. We conclude that detrital zircon compositions in glacial sediments transported several kilometers can be used to establish the regional potential for porphyry copper mineralization.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new tensor decomposition for third order tensors, which decomposes a third order tensor to three third order low rank tensors in a balanced way. We call such a decomposition the triple decomposition, and the corresponding rank the triple rank. For a third order tensor, its CP decomposition can be regarded as a special case of its triple decomposition. The triple rank of a third order tensor is not greater than the middle value of the Tucker rank, and is strictly less than the middle value of the Tucker rank for an essential class of examples. These indicate that practical data can be approximated by low rank triple decomposition as long as it can be approximated by low rank CP or Tucker decomposition. This theoretical discovery is confirmed numerically. Numerical tests show that third order tensor data from practical applications such as internet traffic and video image are of low triple ranks. A tensor recovery method based on low rank triple decomposition is proposed. Its convergence and convergence rate are established. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of this method.},

  abstract = {Although there has been a surge of interest in density estimation in recent years, much of the published research has been concerned with purely technical matters with insufficient emphasis given to the technique's practical value. Furthermore, the subject has been rather inaccessible to the general statistician.The account presented in this book places emphasis on topics of methodological importance, in the hope that this will facilitate broader practical application of density estimation and also encourage research into relevant theoretical work. The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.},

Zircon qualitatively records crustal thickness as its trace element chemistry is controlled by the growth of cogenetic minerals and relative uptake of light and heavy Rare Earth Elements. Jurassic to Neogene zircons from volcanic rocks, sandstones, and river sediments reveal shifts in trace element ratios suggesting major crustal thickening at 80–55 Ma and 35–0 Ma, coincident with high-flux magmatism. An intervening magmatic lull due to shallow subduction obscures the magmatic record from 55 to 35 Ma during which thickening continued via crustal shortening. Protracted thickening since the Late Cretaceous correlates with early elevation gain of the CAP western margin, but contrasts with Miocene establishment of near modern elevation in the northern CAP and the onset of hyperaridity along the Pacific coast, highlighting their complex spatial and temporal relationship.},
